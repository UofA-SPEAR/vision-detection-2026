## install requirements(I recommend using a virtual environment):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Test the pretrained yolo model using your laptop webcam:
```
python .\WindowsWebcamTest.py 
```

## Next Steps:
- After we gather the images and label all the images, we can start trianing the model.
- The script will give us the best model which we can then use on the camera feed.
- We need to see how we can use this model using ROS2
